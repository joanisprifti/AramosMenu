# AramosMenu

 > It is a simple web page for [*`Aramos beach bar`*][1] that aims to show the menu to the customer via their smartphone. The customer has the possibility to scan a QR-code and the menu will be shown immediately without delay and in addition it gives the customer the possibility to change the language between `Greek` and `English`. It has been implemented using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. To allow the page to load from the web the AWS Simplify service has been used.
